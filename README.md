# graphicsengine
OpenGL 3D graphics engine initially intended to be used in my A-level project (https://github.com/LordIdra/OSTRICH). I ultimately ended up writing my own abstractions in OSTRICH, but this project served as useful experience with OpenGL and provided a basis upon which to build those abstractions.
